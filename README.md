# MyMarkerBackgroundStyle
Marker is a markdown editor available in Pop Shop (Pop OS - linux distribution).

Customized Github2.css what was available from marker app.
I forgot where the directory for styles were...

It can also be found in https://github.com/fabiocolacio/Marker

Github2 was first made by https://github.com/MacDownApp/macdown
It was probably modified first by fabiocolacio though https://github.com/fabiocolacio/Marker/tree/master/data/styles
